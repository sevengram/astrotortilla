The AstroTortilla project aims to automate repetitive tasks during a modern day
astrophotography session using plate-solving software to speed up the mount
alignment and GoTo error corrections.

Using AstroTortilla
-------------------

To be written in more detail later on.

Intent of AstroTortilla is to enable using the imaging camera for determining the
need for slew corrections.  Using the imaging camera ensures that the GoTo is
slewed dead-on on the camera view.

The images obtained from a camera are evaluated by a plate solving application,
and initially a wrapper for astrometry.net is implemented. The code for
astrometry.net is freely available, but the astrometric indexes are available
upon request only. For details see the GETTING-INDICES file in the
astrometry.net source package or on the http://astrometry.net/ website.

All copyrights and trademarks are recognized and respected.

Python
------

The application AstroTortilla and the associated library are written in Python
2.6, using WxPython [5] , Python win32all extension [6] and Python Imaging
Library 1.1.7 [7], pywinauto 0.4.0 [9]. Python 2.7 is also supported.
Source includes Appdirs 1.2.0 [10] (c) 2010 ActiveState Software Inc.

Running astrometry.net
----------------------

The astrometry.net is not originally inteded to run on Windows, but it can be
compiled and run under Cygwin [8]. Before compiling the astrometry.net code,
make sure you have the required packages installed and at least with version
0.34 the utils/Makefile updated to compile correctly. See the file
AstrometryNetPackages.txt for list of known packages. To ensure speedy
execution, make sure to disable the bash autocomplete package in Cygwin.


ASCOM
-----

The AstroTortilla is tested on the latest available ASCOM platform available on
the release date. ASCOM support requires the Python win32all extensions [5].


Nebulosity2
-----------

If you are using Nebulosity 2.4+, you might want to use it with AstroTortilla to
make sure your imaging camera is pointing to the correct location.
AstroTortilla can use the new TCP/IP based scripting feature, and depends on
Python win32 extensions and pywinauto package for automating the interactions.
Note:
Nebulosity 2.3 is no longer supported.
Nebulosity 3 is not yet supported.

Astro Photography Tool
----------------------

Preliminary support for Astro Photography tool.
